 * Stage: amount
 *
 * Amounts are usually passed as an integer, and usually x100 rather than
 * using the currency's true fractional denomination ("cents").  Currencies
 * without a fractional unit are still multiplied, so we have to floor to
 * avoid killing the payment processor.
 * For example: JPY 1000.05 would be changed to 100005, but should be 100000.
