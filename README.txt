Donation Interface

To install the DonationInterface extension, put the following line in LocalSettings.php:
  wfLoadExtension( 'DonationInterface' );

All of this extension's globals can be overridden on a per-gateway basis by
adding a setting with the same name, but with 'DonationInterface' replaced
with the gateway's name. To override $wgDonationInterfaceUseSyslog just for
Adyen, add
  $wgAdyenGatewayUseSyslog = true;
to LocalSettings.php.


Some configuration options and default values follow. To change the defaults,
add a line to LocalSettings.php with the new value.

Set these to true to enable each payment processor integration:

$wgGlobalCollectGatewayEnabled = false
$wgAmazonGatewayEnabled = false
$wgAdyenGatewayEnabled = false
$wgAstroPayGatewayEnabled = false
$wgPaypalExpressGatewayEnabled = false
$wgPaypalGatewayEnabled = false

You must also configure account information for each processor as
described in 'Processors and accounts' below.

==== Misc ====

Retry Loop Count - If there's a place where the API can choose to loop on some retry behavior, do it this number of times.
$wgDonationInterfaceRetryLoopCount = 3

Number of seconds to wait for a response from processor API endpoints
$wgDonationInterfaceTimeout = 5

Test mode flag, alters various behavior
$wgDonationInterfaceTest = false

$wgDonationInterfaceEnableFormChooser = false
/**
 * A string or array of strings for making tokens more secure
 *
 * Please set this!  If you do not, tokens are easy to get around, which can
 * potentially leave you and your users vulnerable to CSRF or other forms of
 * attack.
 */
$wgDonationInterfaceSalt = $wgSecretKey

/**
 * 3D Secure enabled currencies (and countries) for Credit Card.
 * An array in the form of currency => array of countries
 * (all-caps ISO 3166-1 alpha-2), or an empty array for all transactions in that
 * currency regardless of country of origin.
 * As this is a mandatory check for all INR transactions, that rule made it into
 * the default.
 */
$wgDonationInterface3DSRules = [
	'INR' => [], //all countries
]

Caching:
To let SmashPig objects use Mediawiki's local cluster BagOStuff cache, add this
to your SmashPig configuration under key 'cache':
 class: LocalClusterPsr6Cache
(no constructor-parameters need to be specified)

Geolocation for donors coming in without country on the url:
Set this to the path of a MaxMind format GeoIP database.
These databases can be obtained at https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/
$wgDonationInterfaceGeoIpDbPath = '/usr/share/GeoIP/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb'

==== Form appearance and content ====

Besides these settings, please see DonationInterfaceFormSettings.php

Title to transclude in form template as {{{ appeal_text }}}.
$appeal and $language will be substituted before transclusion

$wgDonationInterfaceAppealWikiTemplate = 'LanguageSwitch|2011FR/$appeal/text|$language'

Used as the value for $appeal when nothing is given in query string
$wgDonationInterfaceDefaultAppeal = 'JimmyQuote'

$language and $country will be substituted in the next four URLs

URL of a page for donors who encounter problems
$wgDonationInterfaceProblemsURL = 'https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:LandingCheck?landing_page=Problems_donating&basic=true&language=$language&country=$country'

URL of a page listing alternate ways to give.
$wgDonationInterfaceOtherWaysURL = 'https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:LandingCheck?basic=true&landing_page=Ways_to_Give&language=$language&country=$country'

URL of your organizations FAQ page for donors, FIXME: this will change
$wgDonationInterfaceFaqURL = 'https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:LandingCheck?basic=true&landing_page=FAQ&language=$language&country=$country'

URL of a page detailing tax detectability of donations to your organization, FIXME: this will change
$wgDonationInterfaceTaxURL = 'https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:LandingCheck?basic=true&landing_page=Tax_deductibility&language=$language&country=$country'

URL of a page detailing donor privacy policy
$wgDonationInterfacePolicyURL = 'https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:LandingCheck?basic=true&landing_page=Donor_privacy_policy&language=$language&country=$country'

Email address donors should contact with any donation-related problems
$wgDonationInterfaceProblemsEmail = 'donate@wikimedia.org'

Email address donors should contact with donations too big to process online
$wgDonationInterfaceMajorGiftsEmail = 'benefactors@wikimedia.org';

The full URL for Javascript-disabled credit card form redirect
$wgDonationInterfaceNoScriptRedirect = null

Dummy email address associated with donation if donor does not provide one
$wgDonationInterfaceDefaultEmail = 'nobody@wikimedia.org'
/**
 * When true, error forms will be preferred over FailPage specified below

 *    ],
 * ];

 */
$wgDonationInterfaceLogoOverride = [];

==== Debug and logging ====

$wgDonationInterfaceDisplayDebug = false
$wgDonationInterfaceUseSyslog = false
$wgDonationInterfaceSaveCommStats = false

Set to true to allow debug level log messages.
TODO: Deprecate and show how to accomplish the same thing using Monolog
configuration.

$wgDonationInterfaceDebugLog = false

Use sparingly, preferably for a single gateway.  When true, log verbose
cURL output (including IPs resolved) at info level.

$wgDonationInterfaceCurlVerboseLog = false

As donations are sent to the "donations" queue, also log the json blob.

$wgDonationInterfaceLogCompleted = false

==== Currency and amounts ====

Configure price ceiling and floor for valid contribution amount.  Values
should be in USD.

$wgDonationInterfacePriceFloor = 1.00
$wgDonationInterfacePriceCeiling = 10000.00

If set to a currency code, gateway forms will try to convert amounts
in unsupported currencies to the fallback instead of just showing
an unsupported currency error.
$wgDonationInterfaceFallbackCurrency = false

For a gateway that has exactly one valid currency per supported country,
you can instead set this variable to true to make gateway forms use an
appropriate fallback currency for the selected country.
$wgDonationInterfaceFallbackCurrencyByCountry = false

When this is true and an unsupported currency has been converted to the
fallback (see above), we show an interstitial page notifying the user
of the conversion before sending the donation to the gateway.
$wgDonationInterfaceNotifyOnConvert = true

When this is true, and a donor has provided their email address and
opted in to receive emails, send a message to the opt-in queue even
on payment failure.
$wgDonationInterfaceSendOptInOnFailure = false

Ingenico Connect account info is read from SmashPig configuration, but you can
set a map of hosted checkout variant names to IDs here. The logic in this
extension chooses between 'redirect' and 'iframe' variants. The 'iframe'
variant will be used by default for card transactions, and the 'redirect'
variant will be used when bank authentication (3D Secure) might be used. By
default both point to ID 100, the ID number Ingenico assigns to the pre-created
look and feel. At the Connect console, you should create your 'iframe' variant
based on the 'Minimal' template for proper positioning. If you use a variant
based on the 'Responsive' template, you will need to change the
#ingenico-iFrame CSS rules in this extension's ingenico.css to compensate.

==== Queues ====

DonationInterface uses the SmashPig library for queue handling.

Essential queues:
* 'donations': Incoming donations that we think have been paid for.
* 'pending': Transactions still needing action before they are settled.

Non-critical queues:
'payments-antifraud': These messages will be shoved into the fraud database
    (see crm/modules/fredge).
'payments-init': These are shoved into the payments-initial database.
'banner-history': Banner history log ID-contribution tracking ID associations
    that go in Drupal in banner_history_contribution_associations.
    See crm/modules/queue2civicrm/banner_history.
'contribution_tracking': Queue for saving data about the source of donations
    to the contribution tracking table without needing a direct db connection.

Contribution tracking IDs are generated from a sequence generator and used to
generate unique merchant references for payments. These are also used to prefix
log entries about a donation attempt.

==== Fraud filters and blocking ====

/**
 * Forbidden countries. No donations will be allowed to come in from countries
 * in this list.
 * All should be represented as all-caps ISO 3166-1 alpha-2
 * This one global shouldn't ever be overridden per gateway. As it's probably

 * to override by gateway and as such it's always referenced directly.
